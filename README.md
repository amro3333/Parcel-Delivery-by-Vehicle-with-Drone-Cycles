# Parcel Delivery by Vehicle with Drone Cycles
Detailed solution files for benchmark instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone, originally devised by Bouman, Agatz, and Schmidt (https://github.com/pcbouman-eur/TSP-D-Instances) (2019). The solutions feature drone cycles, in which a drone launches and lands at the same node, with a customer delivery in between its rendezvous with the vehicle.

Directories are organized first by topography (Single Center, Dual Center, or Uniform), then by instance size (n20 = 20 nodes). The Uniform topography features instances having up to 100 nodes. For each instance size, the files are organzed according to the drone's maximum flight time using settings proposed by Bouman, Agatz, and Schmidt (e.g. Er_0.2 = the drone has a maximum flight time of 20% of the longest arc in the network). Finally, each solution file is named according to the instance classification originally used by Bouman, Agatz, and Schmidt.
