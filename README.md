# TSPD-BAS-Instance-Solutions
Detailed solution files for benchmark instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone, originally devised by Bouman, Agatz, and Schmidt(https://github.com/pcbouman-eur/TSP-D-Instances) (2019). The solutions feature drone cycles, in which a drone launches and lands at the same node, with a customer delivery in between its rendezvous with the vehicle.

Directories are organized by instance size (n20 = 20 nodes). Folders within the directory indicate the drone's maximum flight time according to the same system used by Bouman, Agatz, and Schmidt (Er_0.2 = the drone has a maximum flight time of 20% of the longest arc in the network). Finally, each solution file is named according to the instance classification originally used by Bouman, Agatz, and Schmidt.
